# PalancaPay
PalancaPay is a privacy-respecting, open-source micro-payment system for informal businesses in Angola, built using GNU Taler. Designed for unbanked and under-connected communities, it enables fast, offline-capable digital transactions in the local currency (AOA), promoting inclusion, transparency, and data sovereignty.
